# Creating a databse with SQL and Python

This is a project part of my dataquest.io course, you can find their solution to this project [Dataquest.io's solution](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission193Solutions.ipynb).

This project involves working with data from baseball games from the website [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org) and edited by [dataquest.io](dataquest.io). 

I will:

- Import data into SQLite
- Design a normalized database schema
- Create tables for the schema
- Insert data into the schema
